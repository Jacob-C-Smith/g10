 ## Download
 To download g10, execute the following command
 ```bash
 $ git clone https://github.com/Jacob-C-Smith/g10
 ```
 ## Build
 To build on UNIX like machines, execute the following commands in the same directory
 ```bash
 $ cd g10
 $ git submodule update --init
 $ cmake .
 $ make
 ```
  This will build the example program, and dynamic / shared libraries

  To build g10 for Windows machines, open the base directory in Visual Studio, and build your desired target(s)
 ## Example
 **NOTE: If you are running the tester program on Windows, you may have to copy example files to the ```Debug``` or ```Release``` directories.**
 The example program parses the input file, and writes the parsed tokens to stdout. To run the example program, execute this command.
 ```
 ./g10_example 
 ```
 [Source](main.c)
 
 ## Tester
 **NOTE: If you are running the tester program on Windows, you may have to copy the ```serial test cases``` and ```parse test cases``` directories to the ```Debug``` or ```Release``` directories.**

 To run the tester program, execute this command after building
 ```
 $ ./g10_test
 ```
 [Source](g10_test.c)
 
 [TODO: Tester output](.)
