## Background
Programs have to do work. Word processors have to process words, music players have to play music, and game engines have to create interactive user experiences. To create an interactive user experience, the game engine must manage user input, simulate game dynamics, and render frames *over time*. This is the bare minimum. Simple cases demand simple solutions, but as the interactive experience becomes more complex, the solutions must adapt to the complexity. 

### A Simple Solution
A simple solution to the interactive experience problem is the game loop. The game loop will sequentially poll for user input, simulate physics, and render a frame. After the frame is presented, the game loop will start over. The game loop will continue until the player finishes the game. 

```c
// An example game loop
while(game->should_exit)
{

    // User interaction
    poll_input();

    // Dynamics
    update_physics();

    // Render
    render_frame();
}
```

If a developer wanted to add more functionality, they might run more functions in the game loop. For instance, one could call a process_audio function in the game loop.

### A bad solution?

The game loop has a problem. It's on a time crunch.  An end user expects the game to run at a specified frame rate N. This means that the game engine must finish all the work of drawing a frame in N‚Åª¬π seconds. Adding more work will, without exception, increase the time to render a frame.

## Tasks and Threads

### Tasks
Tasks are pieces of work the game engine does once per frame. We have discussed four different tasks already, those being *poll_input*, *update_physics*, *process_audio*, and *render_frame*. There is no  *```*update_physics* task defined by G10. Updating physics is  Some tasks work and some tasks are being worked on, so consult the [task list](#task-list) to see what is available.

### Threads
Threads are what get work done. Many threads can be run at one time. Threads are a more flexable solution than the game loop. Like the game loop, threads will sequentially do tasks. Many threads can be run at a time. Some threads are created on an as needed basis, while others will  run until the player finishes the game.

## Schedules
![](scheduler.png)

This is a schedule. Just like at your workplace, the rows are the workers, and the columns are work over time. Each thread has work to do. This work is done once every frame[1.2](#a-bad-solution).

## JSON
Scheduler JSON describes what work is done when, and how much effort is put into said work.
